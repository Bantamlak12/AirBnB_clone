## Description of the project

The ALX-Holberton B&B sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at the ALX-Holberton School - the fullstack software engineering program. The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
- A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

## Final product

## Files and Directories

- models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
- tests directory will contain all unit tests.
- console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
- models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements: 
	- attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
	- methods: save() and to_json()
- models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.

## Storage

Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:
	- Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
	- Provide default value of any attribute
	- In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage

## Data diagram

<h1 align="center">The console</h1>

- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored. 

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## Background Context
### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. 
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What’s a command interpreter?

A command interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines.
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

### General concepts in review

- How to create a Python package
- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- How to manage datetime
- What is an UUID
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
- e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### Execution

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```sh
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```sh
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: 

```sh
$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
```
