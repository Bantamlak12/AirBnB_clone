## Background Context

### Web static, what?

---

Before developing a big and complex web application, The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages

    Style guide
    Fake contents
    No Javascript
    No data loaded from anything

During this project, I have learned how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of the page, it's the the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of the page, the design.
